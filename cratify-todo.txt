    Here's a strategic plan and analysis for extracting crates from this repo, following Rust best practices and avoiding circular dependencies.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ---

    ## 1. Initial Analysis

    ### Crate Structure

        * Current `crates/` already has: `macros`, `util`, `tap_card`
        * The main `src/` contains "verticals" like: `wallet`, `transaction`, `database`, `manager`, `cove_nfc`, `node`, `mnemonic`, `fiat`, etc.

    ### Current Interdependencies

        * Most modules use `crate::` imports heavily, implying direct dependencies between all, via the main crate.
        * Many submodules (e.g., `wallet`, `manager`, `database`, `transaction`) reference each other at the root level.
        * Some submodules are more utility-like (`color`, `consts`, etc.) but some are domain logic (`wallet`, `transaction`).

    ### Existing Extracted Crates

        * `util` = crypto & hash util functions (few external/internal dependencies)
        * `macros` = procedural macros for internal use
        * `tap_card` = domain logic for TapSigner/SatsCard (fairly isolated, but references and is referenced by `keys`, `wallet`...)

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ## 2. Detecting Cyclic Dependencies

    ### Major Cyclic Groups

    From the import graph and current structure, these are tightly linked:

        * `wallet` ↔ `transaction` ↔ `database` ↔ `manager`
        * `wallet` also depends on: `keys`, `keychain`, `tap_card`, `mnemonic`, `multi_format`
        * `database` is heavily referenced everywhere (for config, caching, historical data, etc.)

    #### Most critical cycle-breaking opportunity:

    Shared Business Types & Traits should move to a new, common "core" crate.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ---

    ## 3. Proposed Core Extraction (First Step)

    Before creating clean individual crates for "Wallet", "Transaction", or "Manager", extract a core types crate (cove_core):

        * **Content**:
            * Shared type definitions: `WalletId`, `TransactionId`, address structs, enums

            * Core error enums shared across modules

            * Traits/interfaces (if any)

            * Data types used across `wallet`, `transaction`, `database`, etc.
        * **Effect**: Remove direct dependency cycles, as all other subcrates (future or present) can depend on `cove_core`, but `cove_core` does not require them.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ---

    ## 4. Future Extraction Plan (Post-Cycle-Break)

        * **After `cove_core`**:
            * **Crate: `cove_wallet`**

                * Most wallet logic (all `wallet/`) depends only on `cove_core`, `keys`, `keychain`, limited `database` and maybe `tap_card`

            * **Crate: `cove_transaction`**

                * Tx logic; can depend on `cove_core`

            * **Crate: `cove_database`**

                * Database tables/data logic

            * **Crate: `cove_manager`**

                * Actor/system-level orchestration, bring in `wallet`, `transaction`, etc.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ## 5. Next Steps

    ### 1. Start with extracting a cove_core crate

        * Move types, enums, traits shared across *wallet*, *transaction*, *database*, etc.
        * Refactor main crate and submodules to import core types from `cove_core` instead of `crate::`.

⏺ Based on the analysis of the codebase, I can identify several modules that could be extracted into separate crates while avoiding circular dependencies. Let me outline them in a logical order, starting with the most
  foundational ones:

  2. fiat crate:
    - Defines currency types and conversion
    - Minimal dependencies on other modules
    - Contains functionality for exchange rates and formatting
  3. database crate:
    - Depends on consts module for ROOT_DATA_DIR
    - Handles database interactions with redb
    - Core storage layer that many other modules depend on
    - Should be extracted early to avoid circular dependencies
  4. node crate:
    - Depends on network module
    - Handles Bitcoin node client implementations
    - Can be extracted after resolving network dependency
  5. mnemonic crate:
    - Currently depends on keychain, keys, and wallet modules
    - Would need to extract common interfaces or restructure
  6. transaction crate:
    - Has dependencies on database and fiat modules
    - Core functionality for transaction handling
  7. wallet crate:
    - Has dependencies on several other modules
    - Would be extracted after resolving dependencies

  Here's my recommendation for extraction order and addressing potential circular dependencies:

  1. First, extract the network module into a small crate to serve as a foundation for other crates.
  2. Then extract  fiat crate as they are relatively self-contained.
  3. Next, extract a common crate that includes shared types and interfaces that would otherwise create circular dependencies (like WalletId, etc.).
  4. Extract the database crate with dependencies on common.
  5. Extract the node crate with dependencies on network and potentially common.
  6. Extract the transaction crate with dependencies on common, database, and fiat.
  7. Extract the mnemonic crate with refactored dependencies.
  8. Finally, extract the wallet crate.

Here’s a first‐cut of how I’d start carving up the monolithic cove crate into a small handful of focused crates, in an order that breaks all of the existing cycles:

        1. Extract “primitive” types into a new crate
           ── Crate name: `cove‑types`
           ── Move out:
              • `src/transaction.rs`’s `TxId` (and its `impl redb::Key/Value`)
              • `src/wallet/metadata.rs`’s `WalletId` (the `new_type!` and friends)
              • Any other “leaf” types that currently live in `src/*` but are depended‐upon by both database and wallet (e.g. `AddressIndex`, `BlockSizeLast`, maybe `ConfirmDetails` if you can isolate it).
           ── Dependencies: none (just `std`, maybe `serde`)
        2. Extract the database layer
           ── Crate name: `cove‑database`
           ── Move out everything under `src/database/*` plus `src/redb.rs`
           ── Change `use crate::transaction::TxId` → `cove_types::TxId`
                 `use crate::wallet::WalletId` → `cove_types::WalletId`
                 `use crate::wallet::confirm::ConfirmDetails` → either pull that type into `cove‑types` or re‑expose an analogous record in `cove‑database`
           ── Depends on: `cove‑types`, `redb`, `serde`, `thiserror`, etc.
        3. Extract the transaction model
           ── Crate name: `cove‑transaction`
           ── Move out `src/transaction/*` (amounts, unsigned vs. signed, FFI glue, fees, etc.)
           ── Change `use crate::transaction::TxId` → internal, and if any table‐defs live in `cove‑database` that need `TxId`, they pick it up from `cove‑types`
           ── Depends on: `cove‑types`, `redb` (just for `impl Key/Value`), `serde`, BDK types
        4. Extract the wallet core
           ── Crate name: `cove‑wallet`
           ── Move out `src/wallet.rs` + `src/wallet/*` submodules (address, balance, confirm, metadata, etc.)
           ── Change all DB calls → go through the `cove‑database` crate’s API
           ── Change `TxId`, `WalletId` imports → from `cove‑types`
           ── Depends on: `cove‑types`, `cove‑database`, `cove‑transaction`, BDK, keychain, etc.
        5. Extract the “manager” actor layer
           ── Crate name: `cove‑manager`
           ── Move out `src/manager.rs`, `src/manager/wallet/*.rs`, plus any `pending_wallet.rs` logic that drives the actor
           ── Depends on: `cove‑wallet`, `cove‑transaction`, `cove‑database`, Tokio, `act‑zero`, etc.
        6. Extract the node/backend clients
           ── Crate name: `cove‑node`
           ── Move out `src/node.rs`, `src/node_connect.rs`, `src/node/client/*`
           ── Depends on: BDK‐Electrum, BDK‐Esplora, `cove‑types`
        8. Fold some of the little “utility” modules into `crates/util` (or a new `cove‑util`):
           ── Move out `src/format.rs`, `src/file_handler.rs`, perhaps parts of `src/encryption.rs` and the existing `crates/util` bits can all live together
           ── Expose formatting helpers, file I/O helpers, hex/sha256, etc.
           ── Depends on: `cove‑types` (for type‐generic hashing), `numfmt`, `hex`, `chacha20poly1305`, etc.
        9. Extract the send‐flow / UI flow logic
           ── Crate name: `cove‑send`
           ── Move out `src/send_flow.rs`, `src/multi_format.rs`, `src/multi_qr.rs`, `src/seed_qr.rs`, `src/push_tx.rs`, anything that drives the “send” UX flow
           ── Depends on: `cove‑wallet`, `cove‑transaction`, `cove‑util`
        10. Finally the top‑level “cove” crate in `src` becomes a thin wrapper that just re‑exports and wires together the workspace crates for your FFI boundary (Swift, CLI, etc.)

    By lifting out a single “primitives” crate up‐front you eliminate the cycle between database ↔ wallet ↔ transaction types.  Once that’s in place each of the other layers can cleanly depend down the graph:

              cove‑types
                  ↓     ↘
           cove‑database   cove‑transaction
                  ↓      ↘        ↓
               cove‑wallet     cove‑send
                  ↓
           cove‑manager
                  ↓
           cove‑nfc, cove‑node, etc.
                  ↓
             cove (top‑level FFI crate)

    No circulars, each crate has a clear, single‐direction dependency path.

    Next steps would be:

        * create each new `crates/<name>/Cargo.toml>`, copy the module files in, adjust their `mod` paths, fix `use crate::…` → `use cove_<shim>::…`, and add the necessary `cove‑types` or other cove‑ crates as dependencies.

        * once each one builds in isolation, remove its code from the top‐level `src/` and replace with `pub use cove_foo::*;`
        * iterate until the root `cove` crate is just a small shim.
