Cove is the easiest way to use your hardware wallet on mobile. Create hot wallets in one tap or connect your Coldcard, TAPSIGNER, Krux, Jade, SeedSigner, Foundation Passport and more for cold storage security.

Why Cove?
    •    One-tap hot wallets – Create a wallet in seconds. Your private keys are encrypted and stored locally, secured by Face ID / Touch ID and a PIN you control.
    •    Hardware-wallet ready – Bring your Coldcard, TAPSIGNER, Krux, Jade, SeedSigner, Foundation Passport and more. Cove speaks PSBT and seamlessly signs via QR (BBQr & UR), NFC, or file import.
    •    SeedQR & descriptor export – Scan and export SeedQR backups, plus share xpub and descriptors as QR codes for easy multi-device setup.
    •    Full UTXO control – Select, label and track coins with BIP329 compatibility so your labels stay in sync with desktop wallets like Sparrow.
    •    Tax-ready exports – CSV export with historical fiat prices and UTC/local timestamps for tax reporting.
    •    Decoy & Wipe PINs – Enter a special PIN to reveal a minimal "decoy" wallet or to securely wipe data if you're under duress.
    •    Multiple address types – Native Segwit, Wrapped Segwit, and Legacy address support.
    •    Always in style – Beautiful light & dark modes, modern typography and thoughtful animations make using Bitcoin a joy.
    •    Built for you – Choose your fiat currency, point Cove at your favorite Electrum or Esplora node, and toggle advanced features as you grow.
    •    Open & auditable – Powered by the battle-tested Bitcoin Development Kit (BDK) and 100% open-source code for maximum transparency.
